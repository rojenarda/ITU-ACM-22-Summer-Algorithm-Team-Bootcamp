/*
    Common algorithm to find the single path from one node to another node with the smallest weight Dijkstra's algorithm does not work here.
    The reason why it does not work is simply we are asked to find any path from 1 to n and minimum weighted edge on this path.
    The fact that graph is not necessarily connected is not a big problem since we already guaranteed to have a path from 1 to n.
    So we can just apply bfs or dfs to explore the graph starting from 1 which is guaranteed to be the connected component having edges 1 and n nodes,
    and then just finding the minimum weighted edge will be the answer since we can pass an edge multiple times.
    In summary, apply bfs starting from 1 and find the minimium weighted edge.
