/* My method uses a map to associate heights with the initial       *
 * order. After the heights are sorted in desceding order, people's *
 * names are selected in the proper order, by consulting the        *
 * unsortedPattern map fed by the sorted heights array. In this way,*
 * there is no need to combine the two vectors into one structure.  */
