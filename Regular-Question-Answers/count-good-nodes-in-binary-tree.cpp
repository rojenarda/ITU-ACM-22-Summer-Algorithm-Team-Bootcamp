/*
    What we do here basically is going through the binary tree with a recursive function (util),
    and checking if the encountered node is the largest node on the path we have been used until arriving there.
    So to do that we need root, and largest value. If the nood is "good" node which is defined in the question as
    the being the largest value on the path we used until arriving there, we need to count it so we use also count.
    It should be passed not as a pointer integer instead of as an integer because if it was defined as integer, we would
    lose the counts when returning from the leaf nodes.
