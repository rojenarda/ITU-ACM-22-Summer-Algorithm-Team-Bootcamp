        In the question, n is given as the length of a string, and we are asked to find the number of permutations considering the given rules.

        We can start with one of five different letter {a, e, i, o, u}.
        The description states which letters can be followed by each letter:
            a -> e
            e -> a, i
            i -> a, e, o, u
            o -> i, u
            u -> a

        Let's assume that we have a string of length 5. If we start with 'a', we need to find all permutations of a 5-length string starting with 'a'.
        'a' should be followed only by 'e'. Now we just need to find all permutations of a 4-character string starting with 'e'.
        'e' should be followed by 'a' or 'i'. Now we need to find all permutations of a 3-character string starting with 'a' or 'i'.
        And so on.

        This problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming. I solved it using Bottom-Up approach.
        We store number of permutations for each letter starting with a single-character string.
        Then for 2-character strings, we add the permutation count of the single-character to the possible letters.
        By doing this iteratively up to n, we can reach to the n-character string for each letter.
        The result is equal to the sum of the permutation counts of the n-character strings for each letter.
