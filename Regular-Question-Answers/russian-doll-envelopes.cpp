    The question requires to fit the envelopes within each other. In order for an envelope to fit
    within another envelopes, its dimensions must be strictly smaller than the other. This question
    is similar to the longest increasing subsequence problem. We can sort the envelopes in ascending order
    with respect to their widths and in descending order with respect to their heights and apply the
    "patience sorting" algorithm on the sorted list to aquire the longest increasing subsequence. The
    reason why we sort the envelopes in reverse orders is because we want to find the longest increasing
    subsequence of the heights of the envelopes.

    An example:

    envelopes = [[5,4],[6,4],[6,7],[2,3]]

    Sort the envelopes in ascending order with respect to their widths and in descending order with
    respect to their heights:

    sorted_envelopes = [[2,3],[5,4],[6,4],[6,7]]
                           ^     ^     ^     ^
    [3, 4, 4, 7] -> LIS of this array is [3, 4, 7] -> LIS of envelopes: [[2,3], [5,4], [6,7]]

    Now that the width are in ascending order, finding the longest increasing subsequence of the heights
    will lead us to the answer of the problem. In order the find the LIS, we use the patience sorting
    algorithm. In each step, we check if there the current height can be placed on the bottom of a stack.
    Leftmost stack with a bottom value greater than the current value is the adequate stack. If there
    is no such a stack, we create a new stack with the current height, otherwise we place the height to the
    bottom of the found stack. The number of stacks is the answer of the problem. Search of the adequate
    stack can be done with binary search. This way, in each step we can find the adequate stack in O(logn)
    and in total the time complexity of the algorithm will be O(nlogn).
