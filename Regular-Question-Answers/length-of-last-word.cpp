/* In the question we are given a string and asked to find the length of the last word.
 * To solve this problem the algorithm we will use the two pointers technique.
 * We will use these two pointers to point to the start and the end of the words
 * Our first pointer will point to the end of the last word and second will point to the start of the last word.
 * When we subtract these two we will get the length of the last word.
 *
 * Time Complexity  = O(n)
 * Space Complexity = O(1)
