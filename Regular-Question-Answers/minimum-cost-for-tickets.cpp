/*
    If we simplify the question's statement:
    We have to group days so that we can know what we will pay
    We have grouping options:
    - group by 1 day
    - group by 7 consecutive day starting from current day
    - group by 30 consecutive day starting from current day
    And each of the grouping options has different costs

    To find the minimum cost of grouping we can use top-down aproach

class Solution {
public:
    int mincostTickets(vector<int>& days, vector<int>& costs) {
        int size = days.size();

        // To store minimum cost of traveling the rest of the days, beginning from that day
        vector<int> dp(size, -1);

        // Start from the day 1
        return rec(days, costs, dp, days[0]);
    }

    //  Helper function
    int rec(vector<int>& days, vector<int>& costs, vector<int>& dp, int minDay) {
        // Here minDay parameter represents the day we have came so far.
        // So we need to find the next day (that is larger than minDay) in our vector.

        int startIndex = 0;

        // iterator for the minimum element that is greater than minDay value
        auto itr = lower_bound(days.begin(), days.end(), minDay);

        // if there is no such element, return 0
        if (itr == days.end()) return 0;

        startIndex = itr - days.begin();

        // we have found the next day that is in our list
        int startday = days[startIndex];

        // if the answer of the minimum cost of traveling remaining days is evaluated before, then return it
        if (dp[startIndex] != -1) return dp[startIndex];

        // There are three cases that we will consider

        // 1-) Take one day pass and don't pay until the next day
        int dailypass = costs[0] + rec(days, costs, dp, startday + 1);

        // 2-) Take weekly pass and don't pay until the end of the week
        int weeklypass = costs[1] + rec(days, costs, dp, startday + 7);

        // 3-) Take monthly pass and don't pay until the end of the month
        int monthlypass = costs[2] + rec(days, costs, dp, startday + 30);

        // make the answer of startIndex the minimum value of these 3 cases and return it
        return dp[startIndex] = min(dailypass, min(weeklypass, monthlypass));
