class Solution {
public:
    int reverse(int x) {
        // Since the environment does not let us to store 64-bit numbers, this means we can't use long long variable type.
        // Normal integers are in the range of -2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1, this is about 2 * 10^9.

        // You can get a number's rightmost digit by taking modulo by 10.
        // You can erase a number's rightmost digit by doing integer division by 10.
        // We will use this logic during the operations.
        // ex: 123 % 10 = 3, 123 / 10 = 12

        // Checking for an overflow is unnecessary if -1e9 < x < 1e9
        // Overflow (going over the boundaries) might occur if the condition above is not met.
        // ex: 1000000003, reverse of this number would yield 3000000001, which is above 2^31 - 1.

        // To mitigate overflow probability, a mask and boundary numbers could be used.
        // To get the leftmost digit, a mask of 1e9 and -1e9 can be used.
        // Number would be divided by the mask to get leftmost digit.
        // To shift selected digit right, firstly number could be taken modulo by mask and mask can be divided by 10.
        // ex: number 234 and mask 100, 234 / 10 = 2, 234 % 100 = 34, 100 / 10 = 10, 34 / 10 = 3

        // This shifting and modulo operations will occur log10(n) times, so complexity is O(log(n)).

                limit %= mask;
                mask /= 10;

                // We can work with negative numbers, modulo can yield a negative number.
                // But will always get a positive number from limit divided by mask.
                // Again, to fix that issue we will make sure x_digit is positive.
                if (x_digit < 0) x_digit *= -1;

                if (x_digit > limit_digit) return 0;
                // If obtained x_digit is smaller than limit_digit, no way that this operation can generate an overflow.
                // So break the loop and continue.
