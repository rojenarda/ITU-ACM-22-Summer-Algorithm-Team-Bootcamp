/*
 * This question is a simple monotonic decreasing stack implementation.
 *
 * If we encounter a greater element than the top of the stack
 * pop it until it is ready to be pushed into the stack.
 *
 * 5 4 6 3 1 2
 * 5-4 is in stack
 * 6 is greater than both thus 5 and 4 will be popped and mapped as 6
 * 6-3-1 will be in stack
 * 2 will make 1 popped and mapped as 2.
 *
 * in the end 5->6, 4->6, 6->0, 3->0, 1->2, 2->0
 * for num1 elements return corresponding mapped results.
