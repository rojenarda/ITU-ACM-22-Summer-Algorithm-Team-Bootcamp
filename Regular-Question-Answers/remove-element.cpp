/* First we have to check our element is equal to val.
 If it is not nothing changes. But if they are equal we have to remove the
 element. When we remove an element our array decreases one. So if we swap the
 element - that equals val - and the last element of the array and decrease
 the size of the array we get the wanted array. */
