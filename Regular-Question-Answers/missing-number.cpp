            To find the missing number, we can use Gauss's summation formula.
            In the vector we are given numbers in the range 0 to n, where n is size.
            By using Gauss's formula we can get the summation of the numbers from 1 to n easily.

            If we add up all of the numbers in the vector we will get a total value.
            Then we can get the answer by subtracting that total value from
            the summation of all numbers in the interval [1 , n]

        int expected = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
        int real = 0;

        // Get the summation of all integers in the vector
        for (int x : nums) real += x;
