/* In this problem we want to reverse the order of words with given format:
 *  First word in the string will be last and last string will be first
 *  In other words First In Last Out
 *  We need to use compatible data structure to solve this problem
 *  Stack will help us here
 *  In the algorithm we will iterate through the string
 *  Pick the words and push them into stack
 *  Then pop them out of the stack and store them in a string again
 *  Finally we will have a string whose order of the words reversed
 *
 *  Time Complexity  = O(n)
 *  Space Complexity = O(n)
