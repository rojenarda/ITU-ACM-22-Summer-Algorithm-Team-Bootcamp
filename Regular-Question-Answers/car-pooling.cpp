/*
    Problem Description: The problem asks to determine if a car with a given seat
    capacity can complete all provided trips without exceeding its capacity.
    Each trip specifies the number of passengers, pick-up, and drop-off locations.
    The algorithm utilizes an array to keep track of the passenger count changes
    at each trip and checks if the capacity is ever exceeded.
    The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the maximum distance the car can travel.
