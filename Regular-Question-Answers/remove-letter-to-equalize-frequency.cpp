/*
 * In this question there are so many edge cases that it is very annoying to deal with all of them.
 * That's why brute force solution is best for this question
 * Here is the algorithm:
 * Create a map and calculate every letter's frequencies
 * Iterate through the map and at every iteration decrease a letter's frequency by one
 * Then check if all of the letter's frequency is equal or not. If all of the frequencies are equal, return true
