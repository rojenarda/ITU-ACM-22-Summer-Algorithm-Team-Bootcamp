/*
 * The algorithm used here is:
 * Find parent node of the every node.
 * Then traverse from node p to root. (Here we can traverse from q to root, it doesn't matter as you will see).
 * Create a unordered map and assign true to every node's value while traversing from p to root
 * Then traverse from q to root.
 * While traversing, if the current nodes unordered map value is 1, return it.
 * The main idea here is we have assigned every node's value to 1
 * from q to root at unordered map. That will help us to identify them.
 * While traversing from p to root, if one of them is encountered, that node will be returned,
 * since it is the lowest common ancestor of these two (p and q) nodes.
