/*
    Problem Description:
        We have 2 linked lists. Both of
        them are sorted. We need to merge
        these 2 sorted linked list in 1
        sorted linked list.

    Solution method:
        We will have 2 ListNode s to point
        to both lists. In each iteration we
        will check which value is smaller, and
        we will add the smaller one to our result
        list and increment the pointer of the list
        that contains smaller element.
        After we have done with one list, we will
        add all elements of the other list to our
        result list.
