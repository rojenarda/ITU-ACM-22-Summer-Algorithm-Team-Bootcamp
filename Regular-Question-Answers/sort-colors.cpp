class Solution {
public:
    /* We are given three different integers 0,1 and 2 as representative number of colors red,white and blue respectively.
     * And we are asked the sort them in the given order.
     * Since we will sort this 3 integers we can sort them without using any sorting algorithm .
     * If we keep three different index ;
     * -One for point the end of the array
     * -One for point the start of the array
     * -One for point the index that we are currently processing
     * Then we can sort out that array easily by just swapping since there is only 3 different integers to sort
     * Zeros will be at the beginning of the array ,Ones will be at the middle,and twos will be at the end.
