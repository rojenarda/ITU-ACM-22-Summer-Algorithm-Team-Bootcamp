/*
 To get K consecutive black blocks,
 we should check every substring lenght of K, and count the number of white blocks in that substring.
 Minimum white block number is equal minimum operation number to recolor.

 For the first substring, calculate the white block count and keep it.
 For the rest of that, if next value equals 'W' increase white block count by one,
 if first value of previous substring equals 'W' decrease white block count by one,
 because it is not include new substring.

For example, blocks = "WBBWWBBWBW", k = 7

First substring:
         "WBBWWBBWBW"
          ^     ^
          |     |
        i = 0   i = 6
whiteBlocks = 3;

Second substring:
         "WBBWWBBWBW"
          ^      ^
          |      |
        i = 0   i = 7
s[7] = 'W' whiteBlocks++;
s[0] = 'W' whiteBlocks--;

whiteBlocks = 3;

and it so on until the end of the string,
minOperaion is the minimum of all whiteBlocks

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumRecolors(string blocks, int k) {
        int whiteBlocks = 0, i;

        // We calculate white blocks number of the first substring of length k.
        for (i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (blocks[i] == 'W') whiteBlocks++;
        }

        // We initalize minOperation with first value of whiteBlocks,
        int minOperation = whiteBlocks;

        // Check rest of the string for minimum value.
        for (i = k; i < blocks.size(); i++) {
            // If ith block (last eleman of new substring) is white, increase by one
            if (blocks[i] == 'W') whiteBlocks++;

            // We should check (i-k)th block because it is no more in the new substring,
            // if it is white we should decrease by one
            if (blocks[i - k] == 'W') whiteBlocks--;

            // If the white block number of new substring is smaller, assign it to minOperation
            minOperation = min(whiteBlocks, minOperation);

            // Since it cannot be less than zero, return 0
            if (minOperation == 0) return 0;
        }

        return minOperation;
    }

// Space complexity: O(1)
