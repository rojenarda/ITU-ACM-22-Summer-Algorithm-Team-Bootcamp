/*
    Solution: O(steps * min(arrLen, steps))

    The main idea is to maintain a dp array representing the number of ways to arrive at each point.
    The state transitions are:
        - Move left.
        - Move right.
        - Stay.
    It's all detailed inside the implementation.

    Have fun! :)
