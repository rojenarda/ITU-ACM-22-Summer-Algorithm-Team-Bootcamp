         * This solution is achieved by recursion.
         * Logic behind this solution is to create combinations recursively.
         * Then checking whether the target is met.
         *
         * To backtrack easily, sorting the list first is preferred.
         * This way, if we pass the target, we guarantee that next elements will pass too.
         *
         * Complexity is O(2^n) but since target is guaranteed to be a small number so in reality,
         * algorithm will work much more faster. (There are 2^n possible combinations.)

     * [1] Marking the numbers at the end of the recursion:
     *
     * Ex:  We are targeting 8
     *      Our candidates are 1 1 2 2 3 4 5 6
     *                         ^ Our code starts to generate combinations from here.
     *
     *      In the first itteration of recursion code will generate
     *      1 1 2 4, then 1 1 6 then 1 2 2 3 ...
     *
     *      After we are done with building our combinations with 1, we mark 1 as used.
     *      When we jump to next item: 1 1 2 2 3 4 5 6
     *                                   ^ We will skip this 1 because it is marked.
     *
     *      This small backtracking works for every recursive function call, every marking is unique.
     *      This is why we are calling preventDuplicateCombinations into our function by value (copying into function).
     *      Otherwise we would generate combinations such as 1 2 2 3 second time.
     *
     *
     * [2] Popping the last element from previousNumbers:
     *
     * From the example above:
     *      - We are done with 1 1 2 4,
     *      - Popping 4, last recursive call added 4.
     *      - There is no alternative to 4, returning,
     *      - Popping 2, also marked 2 as used.
     *      - In the end we tried 5 and 6,
     *      - 1 1 6 is a valid combination.
     *      - Popping 6, then popping both 1s, then our previous numbers vector is empty.
     *      - 1 is marked as used, jumping to 2.
