    Solution 1: O(n)

    We can maintain two pointers l and r representing the left and the right endpoints of the subarray.
    Since every element is positivte, when we move r to the right, the sum increases.
    Similarly, when we move l to the right, the sum decreases.
    These two properties show us that when we move r to the right, we don't ever need l to move to the left.
    It's because when the sum gets increased because of r, all we would want is decrease the sum as long as it's
    greater than or equal to the target.

    Fun fact: this method is literally called the "two pointers" method :D (a.k.a. sliding window)

            We can increase r one by one with a for loop, and while doing that,
            increase l as much as possible by another while loop.
            So, there are actually two independent loops iterating separately -- one for each pointer.

                2- It's not less than the largest possible answer, which is n.

    Solution 2: O(n * log(n))

    Instead of maintaining two pointers, this solution focuses on finding the largest j for each position i such that:
        1- j < i
        2- nums[j] + nums[j+1] + ... + nums[i] >= target

    Notice that we can use prefix sums for the second condition:
        prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j-1] >= target

    Since every element is positive, prefix sums are always increasing.
    This allows us to binary search j -> this is where log(n) comes from.

        /*
            We define prefix_sum as 1-indexed where prefix_sum[0] represents the empty prefix whose sum is 0.
            This prevents us from accessing the (-1)-th element: prefix_sum[j-1].
            Strongly recommended! :)

            /*
                We search within [0..i] for the prefix sum closest to target_to_subtract.
                Since we want the largest j s.t. prefix_sum[j] <= target_to_subtract,
                we find the smallest j s.t. prefix_sum[j] > target_to_subtract with upper_bound,
                then go back to the previous index by subtracting 1.

                Since we search within [0..i] and upper_bound takes the right endpoint as exclusive,
                we pass prefix_sum.begin() + i + 1.

                Cheatsheet:
                    1- lower_bound(x) is the leftmost element <= x.
