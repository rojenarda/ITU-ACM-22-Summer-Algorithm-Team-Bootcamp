    /*
     * If we reshape the question, it actually wants us to get the rightmost element of every layer of the tree.
     *
     * GENERAL IDEA:
     * 1 - We traverse the tree layer by layer rather than node by node, we use breadth first search to do it.
     *
     * 2 - Queue is a FIFO data structure, we can make use of this feature when we are solving this problem.
     *     While we are pushing the current layer to the queue, we start from the rightmost element.
     *     We do this to produce a queue that contains the layer nodes right to left.
     *
     * 3 - We need the rightmost element of each layer of the tree.
     *     We can easily push the front element of the queue at each iteration to our answer vector.
