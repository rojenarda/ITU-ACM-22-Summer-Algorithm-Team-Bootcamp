# How to use scripts

All of these scripts must be executed under the root of the repository.

## CheckRepoStructure.py

It validates structure of the repository.

## UpdateTxtFiles.py

It can be used to update txt files of merged problems and all problems.

## SelectRandomUnsolvedProblem.py

It can be used to select random problem based on given difficulty. Note that it is running based on 2 files under the Regular-Question-Answers directory. Which are ~all.txt and ~merged.txt. To keep these files updated above two scripts can be run in local environment before creating pull request.
